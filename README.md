# Ovarian Aid

A web-based medical image classification application designed to assist in ovarian cancer detection using machine learning. This application uses TensorFlow.js to run AI models directly in the browser for real-time image analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose

Ovarian Aid is a thesis project for Fall 2025 that aims to support medical professionals in early detection of ovarian abnormalities through AI-powered image classification. The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading medical images and receiving classification predictions.

## ⚕️ Important Medical Disclaimer

**This application is for research and educational purposes only. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical diagnosis, treatment, or advice. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions.**

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Image Classification**: Upload medical images and get instant AI-powered predictions
- **Browser-based AI**: Uses TensorFlow.js for client-side machine learning - no server required
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for modern, mobile-friendly UI
- **Privacy-focused**: All processing happens locally in your browser
- **User Consent**: Built-in consent mechanism for medical data handling

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.2.0 with Vite
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for in-browser machine learning
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- **Linting**: ESLint for code quality

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ovarian-aid
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 📜 Available Scripts
